#### Project description: 
The virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe (call center) is developing a new function that will give supervisors information on the least effective operators. An operator is considered ineffective if they have a large number of missed incoming calls (internal and external) and a long waiting time for incoming calls. Moreover, if an operator is supposed to make outgoing calls, a small number of them is also a sign of ineffectiveness.

The datasets contain data on the use of the virtual telephony service CallMeMaybe. Its clients are organizations that need to distribute large numbers of incoming calls among various operators or make outgoing calls through their operators. Operators can also make internal calls to communicate with one another. These calls go through CallMeMaybe's network.
